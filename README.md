<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold">Description</h2>

Having faced the problem of tracking down verified leads for resources during the covid-19 crisis, we decided to work on a centralised platform for our city. Jsr-sos has verified contacts and directions to covid-19 relief services(like **oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, food delivery services, medicines, doctors** etc) in **Jamshedpur**. Weâ€™ll add further services like real time data updating of availability of beds in hospitals and isolation centers based on feedback and the usability of the app.

**Jsr-SOS** is an open source project, feel free to fork it and use it as per your requirements.

<h2 align="center" style="font-weight:bold" id="contributing">Requirement, Inspiration & Core Team</h2>

There are a lot of helpful apps/websites out there providing information about necessary resources during these trying times. Then why are adding to this already existing pile of sites? Because all these sites have very few to no leads for my hometown. Some doesn't even have the name Jamshedpur(Jsr) in it. You have to search Jharkhand and see if there are a few of the twitter posts addressed to Jsr. The situation is worsening with each passing day and we had to do soemthing. In an attempt to solve the problem of looking for resources, this a centralised platform for our city.
